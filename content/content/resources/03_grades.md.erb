title: Grades and Grading
---
The final grades for the course will be determined using the following weights:

##### Participation (10%)
There will be many homeworks or in class activities which will be graded "participation only." For these you will receive an automatic 100 if you make a good faith effort, and a zero if you don't submit. However it will not matter how correct or incorrect your response is! In addition, I expect that you come to class on time and are engaged in the lecture and that you comne to the recitiations. That you are respectful of the other students and help creating a positive learning environment. Also that you are responsive to questions and help with discussions and class activities.

##### Programming: (55%)
There will be programming assignments roughtly evert week. Every program will be graded both on correctness and style/design. Homeworks are due on the day of class, at class time. Submissions up to 24 hours late will be accepted but have a 20 point penalty. More than 24 hours late will not be accepted. Submissions that do not conform to the requested format exactly will not be accepted.

##### Exams and/or quizes (35%)
There will be a midterm exam and a comprehensive final exam.
