title: Academic Honesty
---

As stated in the Rights and Responsibilities handbook, "Every member of the University community is expected to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty. A student shall not receive credit for work that is not the product of the student's own effort."

In the real world, programmers almost always rely on colleagues, online resources, books and so on. No one memorizes every single call of an API or every single API. Software Development (and Computer Science) is a very fast moving field where we all build on top of work of others. In this course we try to reflect this reality.

However it is never cool to hand in work that is not originally yours. We take this very seriously and will deal strictly with anyone who hands in work which is not the product of their own effort.

Here is how we determine that in this class

1. You should never hand in code or work that you didn't personally write. Cutting and pasting and changing variable names is not allowed. It is a serious situation if we find that you have handed in work that is not yours.
1. You may ask for "hints" from the TAs or teachers or in the Latte online forum. If you give a hint, it should be general not specifying the code to write.
1. You may use informational resources from the web, like stackoverflow, javadocs, blog posts and so on. But you cannot use the code find this way. In particular you must know exactly how every single line in your code works. You need to know how it got there, why it is there, and what it does.
1. You may not show another person your solution to an assignment, nor look at his/her solution, for any reason. You may not have another person "walk you through" an assignment, describe in detail how to solve it, or sit with you as you write it. You also may not provide such help to another student. This includes current or former students, tutors, friends, TAs, web site forums, or anyone else.
1. You may not post your homework solution code online or ask others for online help. This includes public message boards, forums, file sharing sites and services, or any other online system.
1. A student who gives inappropriate help is equally guilty with one who receives it. Instead of providing such help to someone who does not understand an assignment, point him or her to other class resources such as lecture examples, the textbook, or emailing a TA or instructor.
1.  You must not share your solution and ideas with others. You must also ensure that your work is not copied by others, such as making sure to log out of shared computers, not leaving printouts of your code in public places, and not emailing your code to other students or posting it on the web. We enforce this policy by running similarity detection software over all submitted student programs.
