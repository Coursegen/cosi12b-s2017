title: Class Norms
---
<%= callout("NB", " Many students find it highly distracting and disruptive if people around them are looking at their computer during class, especially if they are not following along. Be respectful and kind to your classmates!") %>

Here are the norms expected from everyone in the classroom:

* You are required to bring your computer to class, and make sure that it's got enough charge to last. The computer should be set up to run Eclipse so we can do exercises together if and when needed.
* Most of the time I will ask that you have your computers closed so you can focus on what's going on around you. If you must use it for taking notes or looking stuff up, that's ok but most of the time it should be closed.
* I put a high value on participation, and I will ask questions a lot and I really hope that you will join in the fun!
