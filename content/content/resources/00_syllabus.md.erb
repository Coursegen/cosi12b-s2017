#### Introduction

*Knowing how to program is a poweful thing. Nowadays software has an important role in just about any discipline, from Physics to Robotics, from Medicine to Computer Science.*

*For me, learning to program is learning a new medium. Like writing or mathematics, programming is a creative, rewarding and powerful tool that is also amazingly fun! I believe that deeply and I hope to have you discover that for yourself.*

    Therefore my overall goal for this course for you is to continue the journey to being a brave and confident software developer. To be inquisitive and self-reliant, comfortable in taking on new challenges.

#### Content

This course continues what you learned in Cosi 11a, and in particular:

1. Get a lot of practice programming and designing programs built up of multiple classes. Decomposing a problem statement and breaking it into steps that can be programmed. Understanding what of all the capabilities available can be used to solve the problem.
1. Complete your learning and understanding of Java as a programming language; introduce and get you comfortable with the wide variety of java libraries and tools used by professional programmers.
1. Begin seeing "Software Development" as something beyond programming, encompassing design, development tools, libraries, debugging and testing and other processes.

Upon completion of this class, students will be able to understand the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) as well as the purpose and usage of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and method overloading. They will be able to create Java application programs using sound OOP practices (e.g., interfaces and APIs) and proper program structuring. They will also learn the new features of Java 8 such as streams and lambdas.

#### Learning Objectives

* Cover issues related to the definition, creation and usage of classes, objects and methods.
* Discuss the principles of inheritance and polymorphism and demonstrate through problem analysis assignments how they relate to the design of methods, abstract classes and interfaces.
* Provide the foundation of good programming skills by discussing key issues in the design of object-oriented software, including programming design patterns and programming testing.
* Cover the basics of creating APIs as well as allow students to explore the Java Abstract Programming Interface (API) and Java Collection Framework through programming assignments.

#### Resources
* A comprehensive set of Powerpoint slides covering each lecture of the class
* A summary "All of Java" set of slides that goes through the whole landscape * The Textbook, Building Java Programs
* Starting midsemester we will kick off small TA-led study groups
* Regular (physical and virtual) office hours with all instructors
* Latte for assignments and submissions
* The Course web site (this site) with details about how the course operates and Useful links for further study

#### Class and Recitations
* Class will be in 3 50 minute sessions on Mon, Wed and Thur. In class there are often tiny pass/fail quizes, as well as reading assignments.
* Recitation is once a week for 1-2 hours, and is **mandatory**. This is when you will learn about the weekly Programming Assignment and get tips to help you through it.

#### Textbook

**Building Java Programs - A Back to Basics Approach (4th Edition) by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp, Pearson.**

We will not follow the book page by page but it makes a useful supplement to the lecture presentations. It contains practice problems and online videos you can use to study for your exams.

#### Software
The required software for the course is the Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 and the Eclipse editor.
